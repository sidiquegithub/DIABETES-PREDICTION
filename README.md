# DIABETES-PREDICTION

About Dataset
This dataset contains medical details of patients, including features such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, and more. The target variable indicates whether a patient has diabetes. The goal of this dataset is to build and evaluate various machine learning or deep learning models to predict the onset of diabetes.

### The goal is to use these features to predict whether a patient has diabetes. 

### Below is a detailed description of each column in the dataset:

- Pregnancies: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- Age: Age of the patient (years).
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), where 1 represents the presence of diabetes and 0 represents the absence of diabetes.

### Usage
This dataset can be used for binary classification tasks to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the given features.
